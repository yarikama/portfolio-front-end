# Portfolio Front-End

[![CI](https://github.com/yarikama/portfolio-front-end/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yarikama/portfolio-front-end/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

The front end of [yarikama.com](https://www.yarikama.com), Henry Hsu's portfolio: projects, technical notes, and a chat that answers questions about them, streamed from a language model I host at home.

Built with React 19, TypeScript, Vite and Tailwind CSS v4, and deployed on Vercel. The API, database and models live in [portfolio-back-end](https://github.com/yarikama/portfolio-back-end).

## Features

**For visitors**

- **Ask about my work.** Visitors ask a question in any language. The answer streams in token by token, with numbered citations that link to the project card, note or resume behind each claim.
- **Select to ask.** Highlighting any passage on the site shows an "Ask AI" button that sends the passage along with the question.
- **Works.** Projects filtered by category. Each card has a stable anchor (`/works#slug`) that citations link to.
- **Notes.** Markdown notes with GitHub-flavored tables, KaTeX math and syntax highlighting, filterable by tag.
- **Contact form**, plus links to email, LinkedIn, GitHub and the resume.
- Dark and light themes, with no flash of the wrong one on load.

**For the author** (`/admin`, behind a login)

- Editors for notes, projects and categories, with image upload by drag-and-drop or paste.
- **Inline autocomplete** in the note editor: gray suggested text from a second self-hosted model. Tab accepts all of it, ⌥→ accepts one word, and Esc dismisses it.
- Unsaved edits autosave to the browser, so a closed tab doesn't lose a draft.

This repo is a single-page app with no server of its own. Every request for content goes to the API, and Vercel serves `index.html` for every route so that React Router can handle it.

## Implementation notes

**Streaming answers.** The ask endpoint is a `POST`, which `EventSource` can't send. So [`services/api/ask.ts`](src/services/api/ask.ts) reads the server-sent events from a `fetch` body stream: it decodes the bytes, buffers partial events, and handles events and multi-byte characters split across network chunks. The tests feed it the stream in deliberately awkward pieces.

**Model output is untrusted.** [`AnswerMarkdown`](src/components/ui/AnswerMarkdown.tsx) renders answers as Markdown with raw HTML and images dropped and unsafe link protocols stripped. An answer can't make the browser load anything. Citation markers like `[P3]` become numbered links, but only for sources the API confirmed at the end of the stream. Markers the model invented are removed ([`lib/ask.ts`](src/lib/ask.ts)).

**One conversation everywhere.** The home page section, the floating chat button and the select-to-ask button all share one conversation through [`AskProvider`](src/components/ask/AskProvider.tsx), so a question asked in one shows up in the others.

**Autocomplete.** [`useAutocomplete`](src/hooks/useAutocomplete.ts) waits for a 150 ms pause in typing before it asks. A newer keystroke aborts the request in flight. It does nothing while an input method is composing (Chinese, Japanese), and it splits words with `Intl.Segmenter`, so accepting one word also works in Chinese, which has no spaces. The suggestion is drawn by an aligned layer under the `<textarea>`, not by an editor library. Each suggestion's outcome (accepted, typed along, rejected or ignored) goes back to the API as training data.

**Performance.**
- The note page, the Markdown and KaTeX renderer, and every admin page are split into chunks loaded on demand, so the home page doesn't download them.
- The main bundle is about 100 kB gzipped.
- Uploaded images get WebP variants at 640 and 1600 px from a backend worker. [`ResponsiveImage`](src/components/ui/ResponsiveImage.tsx) offers them through `srcset` and falls back to the original if a variant isn't ready yet.

**Accessibility.**
- `prefers-reduced-motion` turns off CSS animation, smooth scrolling and the JavaScript-driven motion.
- Every interactive element has a visible keyboard focus ring.
- Effects that only make sense with a mouse, like the cursor follower, are skipped on touch screens.

**Theme.** An inline script in [`index.html`](index.html) sets the theme before the first paint: dark, unless the visitor chose light. The page never flashes the other theme.

## Development

Requires Node.js 22.

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:5173
```

`VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` chooses the API. It defaults to a local backend at `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`. To work against production data instead, set it to `https://api.yarikama.com/api/v1`. The API only accepts requests from local ports 3000 and 5173, so keep the dev server on one of those.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Development server with hot reload |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint, with no warnings allowed |
| `npm test` | Vitest: the answer stream parser, citation links, image variants |
| `npm run build` | Type-check with `tsc`, then build into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |

## CI and deployment

- **CI.** [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs lint, tests and the production build on every pull request and every push to `main`.
- **Previews.** Vercel builds a preview deployment for each pull request.
- **Production.** Vercel deploys `main` to production.
- **Vercel settings.** [`vercel.json`](vercel.json) holds the single-page-app rewrite, a permanent redirect from the old `/archive` path to `/works`, and long-lived caching for the favicon.
